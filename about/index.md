Hello! 

I am Deepika Vadlamudi - a Computer Science student and a Machine Learning enthusiast by heart with interests in the field of Algorithms, Machine Learning,
Deep Learning, Adversarial Robustness. I received my Masters in computer Science Degree from the [Department of Computer Science, Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science). 

I also enjoy writing articles related to the fields of my study. You can find some of my work [here](https://medium.com/@deepika.vadlamudi) on my Medium account.

I am most proud of my work on my thesis - Robust Learning of Halfspaces In The Presence of Agnostoc Noise - advised by Prof. Jie Shen and Prof. Eduardo Bonelli, a copy of which you can find [here](https://www.proquest.com/openview/7b03874315392e1bf5788450720131f0/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y).
I enjoy talking about the technology that I work with and the solutions that I work on.
